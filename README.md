# Django_Radius

Welcome to the Django/radius crossover project please excuse the lack of well pretty much everything I'll be updating things here frequently.

A few small notes:

	1.) Radius was written to use jsdoc automatic API generation.  Most of the functions have API stubs though they don't currently describe the relative relationship 
		of the functions to one another.  
		
	2.) To use the component copy the radius folder into the main Django appication then link to it in your settings file.  I'll put in more of a tutorial later.
	
	3.) Most of the framework is in disarray so I'm currently making no contract about which files/functions will stay or go.
