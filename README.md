More detail on Radius licensing
Radius is currently released under the GPL or GNU public license. GPL is a copyleft style license the same one governing the linux kernel and the GNU public library.
What this means is that you are free to copy and distrubute the work as long as you do not plagarize and use it for profit as is. 

I wrote the software to be free and there should always be a free version of it for people to download. Radius was not designed to be marketed as is.
If someone wishes to make a derivative work with a noticeable difference or improvement I don't make any claims to their software, 
they are free to do with it as they please in true GNU tradition.

Why not MIT license?
I chose something a bit less permissible because I felt that at this point in time the software needed a bit more protection against people trying to monopolize the software. So there is no current "commercially" free version. 
Radius will stay like this for the forseeable future.
Please e-mail me with any questions.


A few small notes:

	1.) Radius was written to use jsdoc automatic API generation.  Most of the functions have API stubs though they don't currently describe the relative relationship 
		of the functions to one another.  
		
	2.) To use the component copy the radius folder into the main Django appication then link to it in your settings file.  I'll put in more of a tutorial later.
	
	3.) Most of the framework is in disarray so I'm currently making no contract about which files/functions will stay or go.
